we need little services to store validations, auth things, and other logic in them

we need a big APIService to merge these services (try to answer Where would you store logic with transcations? And you will decide to make the same solution)



I replaced IRepositoryCRUD<SongEntity> _songRepository; with SongRepository _songRepository; because 
I want to add more specific methods into repos. and service must know that his repo implement these specific methods
and I can't put these methods in a separate interface
